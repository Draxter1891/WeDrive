# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### **Summary**  
**Drive Together** is a community-driven traffic management app that empowers users to report, share, and resolve traffic issues collaboratively. By leveraging crowdsourced data, the app provides real-time updates on traffic conditions, road closures, accidents, and alternative routes, enabling efficient and safer commutes. The app fosters community engagement and aims to reduce traffic congestion through collective action.

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend**: React Native for a cross-platform mobile application with a responsive and intuitive UI.  
- **Backend**: Firebase for real-time database services and user authentication.  
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for efficient, scalable, and cloud-based data storage.  
- **Geolocation Services**: Google Maps API for mapping, geocoding, and route planning.  
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time alerts and updates.  
- **State Management**: React Context API for handling app-wide state.

### **Future Scope**  
1. **Advanced Data Analysis**: Integrate AI/ML to predict traffic patterns and suggest optimized routes.  
2. **Gamification**: Introduce rewards and leaderboards to encourage active participation.  
3. **Emergency Services Integration**: Notify police, ambulance, and other authorities for severe traffic incidents.  
4. **Language Localization**: Support regional languages to expand accessibility across diverse communities.  
5. **IoT Integration**: Connect with smart traffic lights and vehicles for enhanced data collection and automation.  
6. **Carpooling Features**: Encourage eco-friendly commuting by facilitating ride-sharing options.

### **Advantages**  
1. **Real-Time Updates**: Provides up-to-date traffic information, ensuring smarter commute decisions.  
2. **Community Engagement**: Encourages users to collaboratively solve traffic issues.  
3. **Eco-Friendly Impact**: Reduces fuel consumption and emissions by minimizing idle times and congestion.  
4. **User-Centric Design**: Simple and efficient interface for a seamless user experience.  
5. **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to urban and rural settings across different regions.  
6. **Cost-Effective**: Operates on community-driven data, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure.  

You can use this description as a foundation and customize it based on your app’s final features and implementation!
